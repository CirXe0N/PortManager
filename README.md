    DATABASE_NAME: port_manager
    DATABASE_USER: [Username of your MySQL Database]
    DATABASE_PASSWORD: [Password of your MySQL Database]
   ```
7. Save the file. 
8. Run the following commands to setup database schema and to create dummy data:
     
    ```
    $ python ./manage.py migrate --noinput
    $ python ./manage.py createdefaultuser
    $ python ./manage.py loaddummydata
    ```

Authorization  | Token [API KEY of a ship captain] | 



**Available Endpoints**


GET /api/v1/ships/{The Ship captains' ship_id or ship_name}

## Case Description
We manage the Rotterdam port. Ships arrive daily. Every ship has a unique identifier, composed of letters and digits. A ship is loaded with containers. Every container has a unique number. It is known whether the contents of a container imply a fire and/or chemical hazard. A ship may enter a dock. A dock can contain only one ship at a time. On every dock, several people are employed, of which some are supervisors. The first name, last name, address and bank account number of each employee is known. Employees are assigned to a ship in the dock.

**Tasks**
* Create a relational database model of the described situation
* Create a web application using Django that implements the following webpages:
    * An overview page that lists docks with their current occupancy and cargo hazards.
    * A dock detail page with for example the employees, current ship, containers and cargo hazards and a historic overview of ships
    * Provide us with a solution that we can run using the Django development server ourselves, to see it in action.

**Bonus assignment**
Based on the application defined for the port management. A third party like the ship-captain would like to enquire the docks for docking possibilities for his ship. The captain uses a system which can handle 3rd party APIâ€™s via REST.
Every captain which is listed in our system can authenticate in the ship software using his shipname/code and auth-token. This information is shown on the user profile of the captain accessed via a desktop browser.

Bonus task: Our system should be capable to answer REST requests. Show how this can be implemented.
